The user can make a cook and a client account with the same email.

* Cooks can now add meals to their menu, and they can add meals from the menu to their offered meals list. The cook can only
delete a meal from the menu if it isn't in the offered meals list. A cook that is suspended/banned cannot do anything, they get a message
telling them that they're banned.
* Simple test cases have been added (no espresso tests since they aren't required).
* The UML diagram for deliverable 3 has been added.
