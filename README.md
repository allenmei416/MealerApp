The user can make a cook and a client account with the same email.


To test complaints we have the class Complaint_Page that checks for complaints
and issues bans to the cooks.

***Important: On the creation of the Complaint_Page activity, 3 complaints
will be generated every time, each with a corresponding cook. This is due to
the fact that there is no other way to generate complaints currently. This
will let the corrector change the values of the bans/suspensions multiple
times if need be.

Complaint 1: the cook is (a231@gmail.com -- pass: 11111111)
Complaint 2: the cook is (a888@gmail.com -- pass: 11111111)
Complaint 3: the cook is (a@gmail.com	-- pass: 1111111)

These are cooks that are already in the database and that you can login to
using the application.
